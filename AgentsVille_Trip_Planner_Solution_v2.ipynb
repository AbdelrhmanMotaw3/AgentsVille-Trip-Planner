    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary task is to refine and improve travel itineraries based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traveler Feedback**: Incorporate specific requests and preferences from travelers\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Results**: Use evaluation tools to identify issues and areas for improvement\n",
    "3. **Tool-Based Research**: Gather additional information about activities, weather, and costs\n",
    "4. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine the itinerary until all criteria are satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Requirements:**\n",
    "- You MUST run the run_evals_tool to get initial feedback on the current itinerary\n",
    "- You MUST run the run_evals_tool again before calling final_answer_tool to ensure all issues are resolved\n",
    "- **For cost calculation errors**: Use the calculator_tool to recalculate the total cost accurately\n",
    "- **For activity issues**: Use get_activities_by_date_tool to find alternative activities\n",
    "- **For weather issues**: Replace outdoor activities with indoor alternatives during bad weather\n",
    "- **For feedback issues**: MANDATORY - Ensure EVERY SINGLE DAY has at least 2 activities. This is non-negotiable.\n",
    "  * If a day has only 1 activity, you MUST add another activity using get_activities_by_date_tool\n",
    "  * Weather is NOT an excuse - find indoor activities if needed\n",
    "  * The traveler specifically requested \"at least two activities per day\" - this means 2 or more EVERY DAY\n",
    "\n",
    "## ReAct Cycle Process\n",
    "\n",
    "You will follow the THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **THOUGHT**: Analyze the current situation, identify problems, and plan your next action\n",
    "2. **ACTION**: Execute a single tool call using the specified JSON format\n",
    "3. **OBSERVATION**: The system will provide the tool's result, which you must analyze to inform your next THOUGHT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical OBSERVATION Processing**: After each OBSERVATION, you MUST:\n",
    "- Carefully analyze the tool's response and results\n",
    "- Identify what information was gained from the tool call\n",
    "- Determine if the information helps resolve any current issues\n",
    "- Decide whether to continue with another THOUGHT/ACTION cycle or call final_answer_tool\n",
    "- Use the OBSERVATION data to inform your next reasoning and decisions\n",
    "\n",

If you find any day with only 1 activity, you MUST immediately use get_activities_by_date_tool to find and add another activity for that day.\n",

The morning features the FutureTech Breakfast Meet-Up at The Innovation Atrium, a gathering spot perfect for Yuri’s passion for technology. It offers a great chance to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts over coffee and the latest trends in the industry. Around midday, they can participate in the \"Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon,\" a unique combination of tennis and cooking held outdoors. This activity highlights both Yuri’s love for tennis and cooking, providing a lively and energizing experience under clear skies. In the evening, Hiro’s interests come into focus with the AgentsVille Twilight Writing Escape at The Ink Loft. This indoor event offers a relaxed and creative atmosphere for storytelling, reading, and connecting with fellow writers and art lovers.\n",
